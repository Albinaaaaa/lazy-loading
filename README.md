# lazy-loading
Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.  Lazy loading can occur on different moments in the application, but it typically happens on some user interactions such as scrolling and navigation.
